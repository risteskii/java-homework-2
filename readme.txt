Solution short description:

-I created a class Car which has the following properties: id, make, model, yearOfManifacture, price,
,registrationNumber, color
I wrote a constructor method with which i initialize objects. I created a showInfo method, which
prints all the details about the car.
For each of the subtasks, I created a method which checks if that object of the class satisfies the conditions.
After that, I made an array of 30 objects. Then for each subtask, I iterated through the array,
called the according method (isProducedBy, isModelAndOlderThan, isYearManifacturedAndPriceHigherThan)
to check which objects satisfied the conditions and called their showInfo method to print those out.
